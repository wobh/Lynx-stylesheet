* Introduction

This is a stylesheet for making your webpages look like they were rendered in the Lynx browser. When I first wrote this, HTML5 didn't exist and CSS3 was still a work in progress. In some respects this works better than it used to, and in more browsers. In other respects, it needs updating.
